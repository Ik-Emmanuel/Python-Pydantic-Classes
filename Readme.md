# Python Pydantic classes 

used as an alternative to the inbuilt data classes for defining classes with data attributes some key benefits include:
- extending functionalities to include: data validation, conversion and sanitizing. 
- validate that the expected data from a json or API response is to be of a certain structure. Pydantic helps to make those checks 
- useful when loading data and can be used to check that the data is clean as good in a way that is expected  by either using field validation or model validation
